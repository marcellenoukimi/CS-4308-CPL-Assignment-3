# CS-4308-CPL-Assignment-3
Develop a Python program. Define a class in Python and use it to create an object and display its components. Define a Student class with the following components (attributes): 
-	Name 
-	Student number 
-	Number of courses current semester 

This class includes several methods: to change the values of these attributes, and to display their values. Separately, the “main program” must:
- request the corresponding data from input and create a Student object.
- invoke a method to change the value of one of its attributes of the object 
- invoke a method to that displays the value of each attribute.
